Chapter 74HC595 & Bar Graph LED
##############################################################################

We have used LED Bar Graph to make a flowing water light, in which 10 GPIO ports of RPi are occupied. More GPIO ports mean that more peripherals can be connected to RPi, so GPIO resource is very precious. Can we make flowing water light with less GPIO ports? In this chapter, we will learn a component, 74HC595, which can achieve the target.

Project 15.1 Flowing Water Light
****************************************************************

Now let us learn how to use the 74HC595 IC Chip to make a flowing water light using less GPIO. 

Component knowledge
================================================================

Bar Graph LED
----------------------------------------------------------------

A Bar Graph LED has 10 LEDs integrated into one compact component. The two rows of pins at its bottom are paired to identify each LED like the single LED used earlier.

74HC595
----------------------------------------------------------------

A 74HC595 chip is used to convert serial data into parallel data. A 74HC595 chip can convert the serial data of one byte into 8 bits, and send its corresponding level to each of the 8 ports correspondingly. With this characteristic, the 74HC595 chip can be used to expand the IO ports of a Raspberry Pi. At least 3 ports on the RPI board are required to control the 8 ports of the 74HC595 chip.

The ports of the 74HC595 chip are described as follows:

        -   11
        -   Serial Shift Clock: when its electrical level is rising, serial data input 
         
            register will do a shift.

        -   Remove Shift Register: When this pin is in low level, the content in shift
           
            register will be cleared.

    *   -   Q7'
        -   9
        -   Serial Data Output: it can be connected to more 74HC595 chips in series.
